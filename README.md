# Web-Scrapping
Analyze Newswire.com’s Newsroom (https://www.newswire.com/newsroom) for top trends.  Trends could be:

Top places (location) where news are coming from
Categories or Industries
Keywords or Tags.  (Tags #tagMeHere or tagMeHere should count as one)

Since articles on our Newsroom are date delimited, your solution should accept dates to generate the report.  If date is not defined, it should default based on last week’s (7 days) data.
